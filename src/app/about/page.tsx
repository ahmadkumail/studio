              In a world where your data is the product, we chose a different path. We built ShrinkWrap on three core principles that guide everything we do.

                  Your files are yours. Period. We designed ShrinkWrap to process everything directly on your device. Nothing is ever uploaded to a server. This isn't just a feature; it's a promise. We can't see your files, and we don't want to.

              <p>
                ShrinkWrap started as a side project born from frustration. As web developers and designers, we were tired of the tedious cycle of compressing images. The online tools were convenient but raised privacy concerns, while desktop software was often clunky and over-complicated.
              </p>
              <p>
                We asked a simple question: "Can we build something that has the power of desktop software but the privacy and simplicity of an on-device tool?"
              </p>
              <p>
                This question led us down the path of exploring browser-based processing and AI. After months of development and testing, ShrinkWrap was bornâ€”a tool that embodies our commitment to privacy, intelligence, and accessibility. We're a small, passionate team dedicated to making the web a faster, more private place, one compressed file at a time.
              </p>
