            We are a team of developers, designers, and privacy advocates who believe that powerful tools should be simple, private, and accessible to everyone. We got tired of compromising between insecure online tools and clunky desktop software, so we decided to build a better solution. That simple idea is what started ShrinkWrap.

              In a world where your data is the product, we chose a different path. We built ShrinkWrap on three core principles that guide every decision we make.

                  ShrinkWrap started as a side project born from frustration. As web developers and designers, we were tired of the tedious cycle of compressing images. The online tools were convenient but raised serious privacy concerns, while desktop software was often clunky and over-complicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We asked a simple question: "Can we build something that has the power of desktop software but the privacy and simplicity of a modern web tool?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  This question led us down the path of exploring browser-based processing and the potential of AI to simplify complex decisions. After months of development and testing, ShrinkWrap was bornâ€”a tool that embodies our commitment to privacy, intelligence, and accessibility. We're a small, passionate team dedicated to making the web a faster, more private place, one compressed file at a time.
